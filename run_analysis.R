# Title: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
# Data: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset 
# Data Source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
# Project Goal: Prepare a tidy dataset that can be used for later analyses
# Date Completed: May 19, 2016 by PV
#
# R Script Steps:
# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
#	2. Extracts only the measurement on the mean and SD for each measurement
#	3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#	4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
#	5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variables for each activity and each subject

# Step 1: Merge (stack) the Training and the Test sets to create one data set
# 30% of subjects are in test data and 70% in training set (same 561 columns, so can rbind)

test_train <- rbind(test,train)
dim(test_train)
head(test_train)

# Step 2: Add column names to merged data so can keep only Mean and SD for each measurement
## Use data "'features.txt': List of all features" for the 561 column names

feat <- read.table("./UCI Har Dataset/features.txt", header=F)
dim(feat)
head(feat)

#Keep variables that are means or std (note: was a getting a duplicate col name error so deleted dups)

U <- test_train[ , !duplicated(colnames(test_train))]
mean <- select(U, contains("mean"))
std <- select(U, contains("std"))
mean_std <- cbind(mean,std)

# Step 3: Use Descriptive Activity Names for the vars in the Activities Data Set

#Stack activity test and train data, then merge in activity names

# Step 4 Appropriately Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
#Combine subject activity ids with measurement mean and SDs
all_data <- cbind(all_sub_act,mean_std)

#Step5 Create a Second Independent Data Set With the Average of Each Variable
#for each activity and subject
